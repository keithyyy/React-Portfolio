## Usage

When you navigate to the site, you will have the option to read an overview in the "How It Works" section, which provides a high-level overview of what you can do with the site. 

Clicking on `Go Shoppin'` will take you to a login page. If you do not have an account, you may sign up with your email address and a password.

URLFrom there you will be taken to your "dashboard", where you will find a field which allows you to enter an item URL to "Track your shoppin' favorites". When you find an item somewhere else on the internet you would like to save, simply **copy** the URL of that item, **paste** it into the "Add Item URL" field on the *Window Shoppin'* site and click `Add Item`. Behind the scenes, *Window Shoppin'* retrieves useful data about that item (name, description, photo, price, date added) and stores it in your personal shopping cart database. The item will be displayed on your dashboard. Add as many as you wish. If you log out and log back in, your saved items will all be displayed on this page.

Clicking `Check` will tell *Window Shoppin'* to access the site where you found your item and assess whether there has been a price change. If there is, you will see a new price in the "New Price" field.

Clicking `Check All` will check all of your items for price changes at once.

Clicking `Delete` will remove the item from Your Saved Items.

Clicking `View` will allow you to view the item on its own, and provide you with a few more options. You can add a note about the item, which will then display beneath the item description. You can also assign a personalized category to each item so you will be able to view all items belonging to that category. The category name you assign will appear beneath the item name.

From the single item view page, clicking on `Show Me My Goods` will take you back to your dashboard.

When you would like to log out of *Window Shoppin'*, simply click `Log Out` in the navigation bar at the top of the page. 

Application works on many online shopping websites including Amazon, BestBuy, Kijiji, Ebay, Get Outside Shoes etc.
